Alfred rewritten in JS with the help of google gemini

I used google gemini to convert the python bot to node js and to help integrate /commands

To use it make a .env file in the root directory

Make the contents as follows but replace (KEY) with the correct values

DISCORD_TOKEN=(KEY)
CLIENT_ID=(KEY)
FINNHUB_API_KEY=(KEY)

where token is equal to your bot token and clientId to your client id and finnhub api key is your key from finnhub which you'll need to generate on their site

I use a docker container to run the bot on a vps
